<?php $__env->startComponent('mail::message'); ?>

We received a request to reset the password to access [Product Name] with your email address ({email_address}) from a {operating_system} device using {browser_name}, but we were unable to find an account associated with this address.

If you use [Product Name] and were expecting this email, consider trying to request a password reset using the email address associated with your account.

<?php $__env->startComponent('mail::button',  ['url' => '#link']); ?>
Try a different email
<?php echo $__env->renderComponent(); ?>

If you do not use [Product Name] or did not request a password reset, please ignore this email or contact support if you have questions.

Thanks,<br>
The [Product Name] Team
